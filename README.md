Alfred-Google-Translate
=======================

Extension for Alfred that will do a Google translate for you and output the result via Growl.
This extension doesn't use the Google API calls, so it's free to use.

To use it in Alfred the default shortcut is 't' followed by the languages and the text you would like to translate.

Example if I wan't to translate from English to Danish I would type:

t en da How awesome is Alfred?
